# Code Showcase

This repository is designed to demonstrate various code snippets for job application purposes.

## MissouriCastIronMainReplacement

The `MissouriCastIronMainReplacement` script is an ArcGIS Notebook file configured for non-coding employees. It allows them to collect and manipulate data for preparing a replacement model. The model aims to prioritize the replacement of natural gas pipelines made of cast iron with plastic, determining the segments of the main to replace first. The notebook provides a user-friendly interface and comprehensive data analysis for efficient decision-making. This is the first of two phases for the notebook with the second containing substantial confidential data and being unsuited for display purposes.

## Spire_locatorScript

The `Spire_locatorScript` is a truncated Python code designed to create several shapefiles. These shapefiles are intended for use by a natural gas company's locating contractor to identify the location of gas facilities while in the field. The script streamlines the process of generating shapefiles, enabling smooth and efficient field operations.

## UpdateContaminationPolygons

The `UpdateContaminationPolygons` script utilizes Missouri's Department of Natural Resources public REST services to update a gas facility's data on contamination locations. The updated data is crucial for providing accurate information to the gas company's field crews, ensuring efficient handling of contaminated sites.
